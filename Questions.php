GIT
	Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.
	Git can be used completely exclusive of any cloud-hosting service — you don’t even need internet access, except to download it.
	Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions. 
	Git is also specially designed to work well with text files — which, if you think about it, is what code actually is. But one thing that really sets Git apart is its branching model.
GITHUB
	It’s an online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer/server. Unlike Git, GitHub is exclusively cloud-based. 
	Also, unlike Git, GitHub is a for-profit service (although basic repository-hosting features are available at no cost to those who are willing to create a user profile, making GitHub a popular choice for open-source projects).
	GitHub expands upon Git’s basic functionality.
	Through GitHub, you can share your code with others, giving them the power to make revisions or edits on your various Git branches.
	GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories.
